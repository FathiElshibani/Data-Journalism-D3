Data Journalism and D3

This data visualization project explores the associations between a percentage of poverty and percentage of people without health care coverage . 

The data used in the scatter plot was collected from the American Community Survey (ACS) and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) during the year of 2014.

Using the D3 techniques, a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements was created.
